<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! Thank you for taking the time to take a look at my portfolio! My name is Kiyara Hill, pronounced KEE-R-UH. I
  have my Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from UNCC in December of 2020, however I have recently discovered 
  a passion for web development. I am currently a Quality systems Engineer I at Niagara Bottling, a beverage manufacturing company. I started at Niagara 
  Bottling in May of 2020 as a Manufacturing Intern. I was then promoted to the Manufacturing Development Program (MDP), 
  where I completed a 15 month rotational program. In the program, new graduates can rotate through all different 
  departments within the plant. Once I graduated from the MDP I then was promoted to the position I have now.</p>

<p>As a Quality Systems Engineer I maintain the applications we use for Quality DAQ across all plants in our network. 
  These systems include, but are not limited to, Presage, InfinityQS, Sharepoint, and (my personal favorite) Ignition. 
  On Ignition, our team has created and maintained a quality DAQ website application for the plants across Niagara to 
  log hourly quality data. To date we manage 45 plants' databases and Ignition projects between 2 people (myself being 
  one of them, incase that wasnt evident). While working with Ignition I have become fluent in Python, SQL, and found my 
  passion for website/application development. This passion is what sparked this web development journey.</p>

<p>Right now in order to pursue my passion as a developer I have decided to start Angela Yu's "The Complete 2023 Web 
  Development Bootcamp" Udemy course. Through the course one of our first projects was to build a website for our portfolios. 
  Though I have decided to continue to document all other projects I work on as I start my journey on learning more about web development.</p>

<p>Make sure to check back here very so often to check out progress as I add on to this website! Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.</p>
