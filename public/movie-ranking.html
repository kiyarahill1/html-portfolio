<h1>The Best Movies According to Kiyara</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Gladiator</h3>
<p>I used to love watching this movie as a kid. Every now and then I will
    go back and rewatch.
</p>

<h3>Remember The Titans</h3>
<p>I am a big football fan and I love movies that incorporate that.
    Remember The Titans was one of my favorites growing up and I will
    always love it.
</p>
<h3>Waterboy</h3>
<p>
    This movie always cracks me up when I watch it. To this day I will quote 
    this movie randomly. One of the greatest of all time.
